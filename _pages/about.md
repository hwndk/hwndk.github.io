Hello, my name is Hwang Dongha.

I'm sophomore in Sungkyunkwan University, and my major is Software. My main development language is Java, but I can also use C++, Python, Kotlin, Swift. I am currently studying mainly algorithm and app development; especially Backend Development. I studyed some technique to connect application and server with API, and now I'm studying about Database with Firefox and Kakao API.

As I still study about programming, I don't have achivement with programming. But I have some algorithm tools I made to manage client data in my start-up team. Now I'm assisting in the production of a website, named 'plist'. You can check with this URL 'https://plist.kr'.

If you want to contact me, send me an email to 'dongha894@gmail.com' or 'dongha894@g.skku.edu'. Since my main account is the first one, I recommand you to send an email to first account.

Thank you.
